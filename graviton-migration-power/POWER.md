# Graviton Migration Power

## Overview

The Graviton Migration Power helps developers migrate workloads to AWS Graviton processors (Arm64 architecture). It analyzes source code for known code patterns and dependency libraries to identify compatibilities with Graviton processors, generates reports highlighting detected compatibility issues (manual review recommended), and provides actionable suggestions for minimal required and recommended versions for both language runtimes and dependency libraries.

### What This Power Does

The goal is to migrate a codebase from x86 to Arm. Use the MCP server tools to help you with this. Check for x86-specific dependencies (build flags, intrinsics, libraries, etc) and change them to Arm architecture equivalents, help identify compatibility issues and suggests optimizations for Arm architecture. Look at Dockerfiles, versionfiles, and other dependencies,  compatibility, and optimize performance.

Steps to follow:
* Look in all Dockerfiles and use the check_image and/or skopeo tools to verify Arm compatibility, changing the base image if necessary.
* Look at the packages installed by the Dockerfile and send each package to the knowledge_base_search tool to check each package for Arm compatibility. If a package is not compatible, change it to a compatible version. When invoking the tool, explicitly ask "Is [package] compatible with Arm architecture?" where [package] is the name of the package.
* Look at the contents of any requirements.txt files line-by-line and send each line to the knowledge_base_search tool to check each package for Arm compatibility. If a package is not compatible, change it to a compatible version.
* Look at the codebase that you have access to, and determine what the language used is.
* Run the migrate_ease_scan tool on the codebase, using the appropriate language scanner based on what language the codebase uses.
* Provide an analysis report with complete dependency analysis, migration recommendations and optimizations for AWS Graviton processor
* Get a confirmation with user before proceeding with the code changes

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

Before using the Graviton Migration Power, ensure the following are installed and running:

#### Required Tools

1. **Docker Desktop**: Required for running the Arm MCP server and migration assessment tools
   - Verify installation: `docker --version`
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running: `docker ps`
   - **CRITICAL**: If Docker is not installed or not running, DO NOT proceed with migration assessment

2. **Git** (optional but recommended): For scanning remote repositories
   - Verify installation: `git --version`

### Step 1: Validate MCP Server Connection

The power uses the Arm MCP server running in a Docker container. Test the connection:

```bash
# The MCP server should auto-start when you use the power
# If you encounter issues, verify Docker is running
docker ps
```

### Step 2: Understand Available Tools

This power provides access to several specialized tools:

- **migrate-ease scan**: Scans codebases for Arm compatibility issues (C++, Python, Go, JS, Java)
- **skopeo**: Inspects container images remotely for architecture support
- **knowledge base search**: Searches Arm documentation for migration guidance
- **check image**: Quick Docker image architecture verification
- **mca (Machine Code Analyzer)**: Analyzes assembly code performance predictions

## Steering Files

- **karpenter-graviton-migration.md** — Guides detection and migration of Karpenter configurations (NodePool, EC2NodeClass) to use Graviton ARM64 instances. Covers gradual rollout with taints/tolerations, instance family mappings, and post-migration cleanup. Manual inclusion — when Karpenter resources (NodePool, EC2NodeClass) are detected in the workspace, prompt the user: *"I noticed Karpenter configurations in your workspace. Would you like to activate the `#karpenter-graviton-migration` steering for guidance on migrating to Graviton?"*
