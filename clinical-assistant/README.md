# clinical-assistant

Healthcare professionals face increasing challenges in managing complex patient data and making timely, accurate decisions. This lab demonstrates how to build a clinical assistant using AWS technologies that can assist providers by integrating multiple data sources and AI capabilities.
As a healthcare provider, we want an AI agent that analyzes a patient’s current symptoms, medical history, and existing documentation to recommend an accurate and personalized course of action. The agent shall help with the following:

- Ingest and understand the patient’s current symptoms and complaints.
- Retrieve relevant historical medical records and documentation through MCP servers.
- Utilize AWS Strands SDK to orchestrate the AI agent’s reasoning, planning, and tool invocation, enabling dynamic and flexible decision-making workflows.
- Run Agents, LiteLLM and MCP servers on EC2 instances powered by Amazon EKS, optimizing cost and performance.
